    <h1>LifeWatch Open Science Framework</h1>
    <hr />
    <p><strong><big>LifeWatch Open Science Framework</big></strong> is part of the adaptation and improvement of the internationalization of the e-Infrastructure existing  in the Singular Scientific and Technical Infrastructure of the Doñana Biological Reserve <strong><small>(ICTS-RBD)</small></strong>, an infrastructure managed from the Doñana Biological Station - Spanish Council for Scientific Research <strong><small>(EBD-CSIC)</small></strong> from the perspective of updating the Information and Knowledge Systems involved in monitoring natural processes, and its relevance to the <strong><small>ESFRI-LIFEWATCH</small></strong> as part of the Spanish "in kind" contribution to the <strong><small>ESFRI</small></strong> (Research Infrastructure approved by the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures).</p>
<p>Specifically, this project contributes to the development of an ICT e-infrastructure to support the monitoring processes involved in the global change for the ICTS - Doñana Biological Reserve, by implementing a Preservation Open Data Platform aimed specifically at the issue of <strong><small>ESFRI LIFEWATCH</small></strong>.</p>
<p>LifeWatch Open Science Framework provides planning tools to LifeWatch community, solutions for data ingestion and access to external services, integration and control of remote sensors, and preservation and exploitation of the analysis and results produced by the ESFRI LifeWatch, all in an Open Data context.
LifeWatch Open Science Framework has been funded with support from the European Commission through ERDF for the implementation and operation of ESFRI projects, and it is managed by the RU LifeWatch Spain.</p>

    <h1>LifeWatch Open Science Framework</h1>
    <hr/>

    <h3 id="lwframe-intro">Introduction</h3>
    <p>The LifeWatch Open Science Framework is an appropiate tool for general 
       public and scientist since it brings specific features according to the
       needs of each user. 
       <ul>
       <li>Different kind of records-data management plans (DMPs), 
       datasets, software, and analysis-can be discover through 
       <a href="{{ url_for('search') }}">Search</a>.</li>
       <li>Authenticated users 
       can go a step further and deposit their own records through 
       <a href="{{ url_for('deposit') }}">Deposit</a>.</li> 
       <li>By default, the deposits
       will nest in the default community 
       <a href="/collection/community-daap">
       {{ config.CFG_SITE_NAME }}</a>,
       and also in any other specfied during the record creation. Then, a
       curation proccess happens: the community admins are in charge of 
       accepting or rejecting the uploads according to the corresponding
       curation policy. Once the records are curated they will be discoverable
       for the general public.</li> 
       <li>A persistent identifier is associated internally
       to each of the records created in the framework; additionally a 
       Digital Object Identifier (DOI) can be mint to have those records 
       uniquely citeable widely: the researcher decide when to mint the DOI.</li> 
       <li>Software and analysis records come with a non-pasive feature, 
       an execution environment accesible through the framework at 
       <a href="{{ url_for('analyze') }}">Analyze</a>.</li>
       <li>Researchers can define the entire life cycle of their research 
       through the workflow define in 
       <a href="{{ url_for('projects') }}">Projects</a>.</li>
       <li>Research records associated to this framework are stored safely 
       and preserve in cloud infrastructure and disk tape(?).</li>
       </ul>
    </p>

    <h3 id="lwframe-discover">Discover</h3>
    <p>Discover {{ config.CFG_SITE_NAME }} 
    public records performing a general 
    <a href="{{ url_for('search') }}">search</a> or filtering them for 
    record type-DMP, Dataset, Software, Analysis- or for 
    <a href="{{ url_for('communities') }}">communities</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="lwframe-share">Share</h3>
    <p>Become a {{ config.CFG_SITE_NAME }} user by logging into the portal,
    and start creating your own records through 
    <a href="{{ url_for('deposit') }}">Deposit</a>. A minimun amount of 
    information will be required in order
    to upload a record: title, authors, description, access rights to be granted;
    in addition for those records that are not analysis records 
    a minimun of one file needs to be also provided. 
    A persistent and unique identifier is associated internally                     
    to each of these records; the scientist is also capable of
    minting a DOI for its own record. Metadata and 
    upload files for those records are editable 
    until a DOI has been minted. 
    All records are accesible through <a href="{{ url_for('deposit.myuploads') }}">
    My Uploads</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="lwframe-analyze">Analyze</h3>
    <p>The {{ config.CFG_SITE_NAME }} brings also to the researchers with a 
    non-passive feature, an execution environment defined by the research
    itself. There are several combinations to build the execution environments
    depending on the flavor, the operating system, and the application 
    environment choosen. This feature is accesible for the <strong>Run</strong>
    button at the software and analysis records: the predefined requirements
    will be loaded into the request and the user only will confirm that wants to
    run the associated instance. The user also can access this directly through
    <a href ="{{ url_for('analyze.launch') }}">Run an analysis</a>.
    The scientist can list, connect and terminate their instances.    
    </p>

    <h3 id="lwframe-project">Project</h3>
    <p>The steps describe above are used in 
    <a href="{{ url_for('projects') }}">Projects</a> to describe the entire
    data life cycle. Projects are visible from 
    <a href="{{ url_for('projects.myprojects') }}">
    My Projects</a>.</p>
